===Info for c programs===

=Basic usage=
    1. compile the program (gcc [filename])
    2. run the program (./[nameOfExecutable])

=Options=
    1. -o [nameOfExecutable]             default name is a.out, if option is specified names it [nameOfExecutable]
        gcc source.c -o program

    2.  -Wg                              compiles the program and shows warning

    3. -Werrorg                          compiles the program and shows the warning if errors in program
        gcc source.c -Werror -o program

    4. -Wallg                            checks not only for errors but also for any kind of warning like unused variables (good practice)
        gcc source.c -Wall -o program        

    5. -gg                               Permission to debug the program
        gcc -ggdb3 source.c Wall -o program  (permission to debug the program using gdb)

    6. -lg                               Links a library to our source file
        gcc -Wall source.c -o program -lm  (the "m" links math.h)
        Always have to link math file because it's function come from a library which is not linked by default (in contrast to stdio.h functions)


=Measuring time=
    1.  #include <stdio.h>
        #include <time.h>

        int main() {
            clock_t tic = clock();

            printf("Hello my man\n");

            clock_t toc = clock();
            printf("Time elapsed: %fs\n", (double)(toc - tic) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC);
        }
